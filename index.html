            <h2>The Idea</h2>
            <p>Designed for your iPhone/iPad to create the ULTIMATE rock climbing experience. Climb your way through routes and explore the outdoors! Collect points and avoid obstacles such as giant spiders, falling rocks, and treacherous caves while going for some serious crimps and holds.<br /></b>Send it!</p>

            <h2>Target Audience</h2>
            <p>iPhone and iPad users. 6+ years old. </p>

            <h2>Device and System Requirements</h2>
            <p>As for now, the app will only be available to use on iOS, so you must own an iPhone or an iPad to run 'Send It'. The plan is to write the app in Swift 4.0 as that is the current standard for writing iOS apps. The app will only store local
                data for highscores and will not require any sort of server to facilitate this. Likely we will only need to use UserDefaults.</p>

            <h2>Testimonials</h2>
            <h3>Delen Albert</h3>
            <p>I love it. The idea is straightforward and simple and will most likely involve quick reflexes and timing, which are key to obstacle-based 8-bit games. I would play it, and I think where it's at now in concept, you have enough elements.</p>
            <h3>Andrew Peacock</h3>
            <p>I like the idea! I like the overall idea and could see myself playing something like that.</p>
            <h3>Kyra Kamiya</h3>
            <p>It kinda sounds like temple run but climbing so I think it would be a hit!</p>
            <h3>Erin Ewers</h3>
            <p>This game sounds sweet. I would totally want to play this. I am too scared to actually go rock climbing so this is perfect for me! It sounds like it would be addicting-which is good. </p>
